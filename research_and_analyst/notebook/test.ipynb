It is commonly referred to as \"the cloud\".\\n\\n\\n== Characteristics ==\\nIn 2011, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) identified five \"essential characteristics\" for cloud systems. Below are the exact definitions according to NIST:\\n\\nOn-demand self-service: \"A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.\"\\nBroad network access: \"Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).\"\\nResource pooling: \" The provider\\'s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.\"\\nRapid elasticity: \"Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.\"\\nMeasured service: \"Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.\\nBy 2023, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) had expanded and refined the list.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe history of cloud computing extends to the 1960s, with the initial concepts of time-sharing becoming popularized via remote job entry (RJE). The \"data center\" model, where users submitted jobs to operators to run on mainframes, was predominantly used during this era. This was a time of exploration and experimentation with ways to make large-scale computing power available to more users through time-sharing, optimizing the infrastructure, platform, and applications, and increasing efficiency for end users.\\nThe \"cloud\" metaphor for virtualized services dates to 1994, when it was used by General Magic for the universe of \"places\" that mobile agents in the Telescript environment could \"go\". The metaphor is credited to David Hoffman, a General Magic communications specialist, based on its long-standing use in networking and telecom. The expression cloud computing became more widely known in 1996 when Compaq Computer Corporation drew up a business plan for future computing and the Internet. The company\\'s ambition was to supercharge sales with \"cloud computing-enabled applications\". The business plan foresaw that online consumer file storage would likely be commercially successful. As a result, Compaq decided to sell server hardware to internet service providers.\\nIn the 2000s, the application of cloud computing began to take shape with the establishment of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2002, which allowed developers to build applications independently. In 2006 Amazon Simple Storage Service, known as Amazon S3, and the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) were released. In 2008 NASA\\'s development of the first open-source software for deploying private and hybrid clouds.\\nThe following decade saw the launch of various cloud services. In 2010, Microsoft launched Microsoft Azure, and Rackspace Hosting and NASA initiated an open-source cloud-software project, OpenStack. IBM introduced the IBM SmartCloud framework in 2011, and Oracle announced the Oracle Cloud in 2012. In December 2019, Amazon launched AWS Outposts, a '), Document(metadata={'title': 'Blue–green deployment', 'summary': 'In software engineering, blue–green deployment is a method of installing changes to a web, app, or database server by swapping alternating production and staging servers.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue%E2%80%93green_deployment'}, page_content='In software engineering, blue–green deployment is a method of installing changes to a web, app, or database server by swapping alternating production and staging servers.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nIn blue–green deployments, two servers are maintained: a \"blue\" server and a \"green\" server. At any given time, only one server is handling requests (e.g., being pointed to by the DNS). For example, public requests may be routed to the blue server, making it the production server and the green server the staging server, which can only be accessed on a private network. Changes are installed on the non-live server, which is then tested through the private network to verify the changes work as expected. Once verified, the non-live server is swapped with the live server, effectively making the deployed changes live.\\nUsing this method of software deployment offers the ability to quickly roll back to a previous state if anything goes wrong. This rollback is achieved by simply routing traffic back to the previous live server, which still does not have the deployed changes. An additional benefit to the blue–green method of deployment is the reduced downtime for the server. Because requests are routed instantly from one server to the other, there is ideally no period where requests will be unfulfilled.\\nThe blue–green deployment technique is often contrasted with the canary release deployment technique and it has similarities with  A/B testing.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nDan North and Jez Humble encountered differences between their test environments and the production environment while running Oracle WebLogic Server for a client sometime around 2005. To ensure safe deployment, they introduced a method where the new application version was deployed alongside the live system. This approach allowed for thorough testing and easy rollback in case of issues. The team initially considered naming these environments A and B but decided against it to avoid the perception that one was primary and the other secondary. They instead chose color-based names like blue, green, orange, and yellow, eventually using only blue and green since \"having two was sufficient\". This naming convention was adopted while working on the original Continuous delivery book published in 2010  and became a common term in the industry afterwards.\\n\\n\\n== Benefits and challenges ==\\nBlue–green deployment is widely recognized for its ability to reduce downtime during application updates and minimize the risk of introducing defects into production environments. By maintaining two separate environments—blue (the current live environment) and green (the environment with the updated version)—traffic can easily be switched between the two, ensuring that updates are rolled out without disrupting users. This method enables quick rollback in case of deployment failure, thus improving overall system resilience and user experience.\\nWhile blue–green deployment reduces risks during updates, it also requires additional resources since two environments need to be maintained simultaneously. The cost of running duplicate infrastructure, even temporarily, can be prohibitive for smaller organizations. Furthermore, complex database migrations may pose challenges, as the system must ensure that both the blue and green environments have consistent data. Solutions to these issues often involve using database migration tools that allow for backward compatibility between environments.\\n\\n\\n== Implementation ==\\nThere are several approaches to implementing blue–green deployments, each offering varying levels of automation and ease of use depending on the platform and tools available.\\n\\n\\n=== AWS CodeDeploy ===\\nAWS CodeDeploy facilitates blue–green deployments by automating the entire process across services such as Amazon EC2 and AWS Lambda. The service shifts traffic between the old (blue) environment and the new (green) environment, minimizing downtime and ensuring a smooth transition.

Serverless computing is a broad ecosystem that includes the cloud provider, Function as a Service (FaaS), managed services, tools, frameworks, engineers, stakeholders, and other interconnected elements, according to Sheen Brisals.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nServerless is a misnomer in the sense that servers are still used by cloud service providers to execute code for developers.  The definition of serverless computing has evolved over time, leading to varied interpretations. According to Ben Kehoe, serverless represents a spectrum rather than a rigid definition. Emphasis should shift from strict definitions and specific technologies to adopting a serverless mindset, focusing on leveraging serverless solutions to address business challenges.\\nServerless computing does not eliminate complexity but shifts much of it from the operations team to the development team. However, this shift is not absolute, as operations teams continue to manage aspects such as identity and access management (IAM), networking, security policies, and cost optimization. Additionally, while breaking down applications into finer-grained components can increase management complexity, the relationship between granularity and management difficulty is not strictly linear. There is often an optimal level of modularization where the benefits outweigh the added management overhead.\\nAccording to Yan Cui, serverless should be adopted only when it helps to deliver customer value faster. And while adopting, organizations should take small steps and de-risk along the way.\\n\\n\\n== Challenges ==\\nServerless applications are prone to fallacies of distributed computing. In addition, they are prone to the following fallacies:\\n\\nVersioning is simple\\nCompensating transactions always work\\nObservability is optional\\n\\n\\n=== Monitoring and debugging ===\\nMonitoring and debugging serverless applications can present unique challenges due to their distributed, event-driven nature and proprietary environments. Traditional tools may fall short, making it difficult to track execution flows across services. However, modern solutions such as distributed tracing tools (e.g., AWS X-Ray, Datadog), centralized logging, and cloud-agnostic observability platforms are mitigating these challenges. Emerging technologies like OpenTelemetry, AI-powered anomaly detection, and serverless-specific frameworks are further improving visibility and root cause analysis. While challenges persist, advancements in monitoring and debugging tools are steadily addressing these limitations.\\n\\n\\n=== Security ===\\nAccording to OWASP, serverless applications are vulnerable to variations of traditional  attacks, insecure code, and some serverless-specific attacks (like Denial of Wallet). So, the risks have changed and attack prevention requires a shift in mindset.\\n\\n\\n=== Vendor lock-in ===\\nServerless computing is provided as a third-party service. Applications and software that run in the serverless environment are by default locked to a specific cloud vendor. This issue is exacerbated in serverless computing, as with its increased level of abstraction, public vendors only allow customers to upload code to a FaaS platform without the authority to configure underlying environments. More importantly, when considering a more complex workflow that includes Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS), a BaaS offering can typically only natively trigger a FaaS offering from the same provider. This makes the workload migration in serverless computing virtually impossible. Therefore, considering how to design and deploy serverless workflows from a multi-cloud perspective could mitigate th'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Amazon (company)', 'summary': 'Amazon.com, Inc., doing business as Amazon, is an American multinational technology company engaged in e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The Amazon website launched for public sales on July 16, 1995, and initially sourced its books directly from wholesalers and publishers. Bezos retained the URL www.relentless.com, which he purchased when considering a name for the company; it redirects to the Amazon homepage.\\nAmazon went public in May 1997.

Security and governance is more complicated, and more \"moving parts\" may create resiliency issues.\\n\\n\\n== Difference between multicloud and hybrid cloud ==\\nMulticloud differs from hybrid cloud in that it refers to multiple cloud services from different vendors rather than multiple deployment modes (on-premises hardware, and public and private, cloud hosting). However, when considering a broad definition of multi-cloud, hybrid cloud can still be regarded as a special form of multi-cloud.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nCloud computing\\nServerless computing\\n\\n\\n== References =='), Document(metadata={'title': 'Cloud Native Computing Foundation', 'summary': 'The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is a subsidiary of the Linux Foundation founded in 2015 to support cloud-native computing.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Native_Computing_Foundation'}, page_content='The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is a subsidiary of the Linux Foundation founded in 2015 to support cloud-native computing.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nIt was announced alongside Kubernetes 1.0, an open source container cluster manager, which was contributed to the Linux Foundation by Google as a seed technology.

These services allow secure, reliable file transfers while offering the scalability, redundancy, and high availability of cloud infrastructure.\\n\\n\\n== Technical overview ==\\nThe evolution of file transfer protocols began with File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). SFTP offered enhanced security through the use of SSH (Secure Shell) encryption, which addressed many of the security concerns associated with traditional FTP.\\nOver time, as businesses increasingly adopted cloud infrastructure, the demand for services that integrate secure file transfer with cloud storage led to the rise of Cloud-Based Secure File Transfer services. These services combine the benefits of secure, encrypted file transfer with the scalability and flexibility of cloud-based storage systems.\\nTraditional on-premises SFTP typically involves setting up and managing physical or virtual servers to handle file transfers. In contrast, Cloud-Based Secure File Transfer utilizes managed cloud infrastructure, such as AWS EC2, Azure VMs, or Google Cloud, to automate scaling, ensure redundancy, and provide high availability. These cloud environments can be configured to automatically scale with demand, enabling businesses to handle large volumes of data transfers without the need for extensive physical hardware.\\n\\n\\n== Features ==\\nScalability and availability: Cloud-Based Secure File Transfer services are inherently scalable, with features like load balancing, multi-region deployments, and auto-scaling groups that adjust resources in response to traffic spikes. This ensures that the system can handle varying workloads and provides continuous availability, even during high-demand periods.\\nCost-effectiveness: By eliminating the need for physical infrastructure and reducing ongoing server maintenance costs, Cloud-Based Secure File Transfer services offer significant cost savings compared to traditional on-premises services. Cloud providers typically offer pay-as-you-go pricing models, where users only pay for the resources they use, further optimizing costs.\\nSecurity and compliance: Cloud-Based Secure File Transfer products offer strong security measures, including end-to-end encryption, key management, detailed logging, and auditing. These services are often compliant with industry regulations such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), and SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls), ensuring that data transfers meet necessary security and privacy standards.\\n\\n\\n== Cloud-Based Secure File Transfer providers ==\\n\\n\\n== Uses ==\\nCloud-Based Secure File Transfer is used across various industries to securely transfer sensitive data and integrate into business workflows. In healthcare, Cloud-Based Secure File Transfer is essential for securely transferring electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), ensuring compliance with regulations like HIPAA. In financial institutions, it is used to protect sensitive financial data during transfer, maintaining privacy and security. Data analytics also benefits from Cloud-Based Secure File Transfer, offering a secure and efficient method for transferring large datasets between systems or partners.\\nTechnically, Cloud-Based Secure File Transfer is often integrated into enterprise workflows through automated file transfers, using scripting or APIs. It also plays a key role in cloud backup and disaster recovery, ensuring that files are securely transferred and stored in cloud environments, which supports business continuity.\\nHowever, businesses must address certain implementation challenges.

In Israel, its platform has been used by the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem municipalities and the volunteer emergency organization United Hatzalah.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nCarbyne was founded in April 2015 by Amir Elichai (who serves as CEO), along with Alex Dizengoff (CTO), Yony Yatsun, and Lital Leshem under the name Reporty Homeland Security. The startup initially developed a platform for live video streaming and geolocation data to assist emergency call centers.\\nThe company rebranded to Carbyne in early 2018 – a name referencing an extremely strong allotrope of carbon. By 2018 Carbyne had raised about $24 million in venture funding (including backing from Founders Fund, the first Israeli startup in that fund’s portfolio) and was valued near $100 million.\\nIn April 2019, the company began collaborating with Cisco, the network equipment giant, to incorporate their hardware into its systems. Two months later, Carbyne announced a partnership with Google to integrate Android phone location services into emergency command centers across Mexico.\\nCarbyne established its headquarters in New York City in October 2019 while maintaining R&D operations in Tel Aviv, and it expanded with offices in the United States, Mexico, Europe, India, and Ukraine.\\nIn 2025, it secured a $100 million funding round led by strategic partners like AT&T, and reported deployments in roughly 300 emergency response centers worldwide.\\n\\n\\n== Products ==\\nCarbyne develops cloud-based “Next Generation 911” (NG911) solutions aimed at modernizing emergency communication. Its platform enables real-time transmission of rich data from callers to public safety answering points (PSAPs). For example, when a distress call is made, Carbyne’s system can provide the 911 dispatcher with the caller’s precise GPS location, live video feed from the caller’s smartphone camera, audio streaming, text messaging, and other telemetry in parallel with the voice call. The company offers both an app-based service and an app-free option. With the Carbyne mobile app (previously called “C-Now”), users can pre-install it on iOS or Android to automatically send video and location data during an emergency call.\\nAlternatively, Carbyne’s web-based feature (known as “C-Lite”) allows a 911 center to text an auto-generated URL link to a caller, which when tapped activates the phone’s camera and streams video and location to the dispatcher – all without requiring the caller to have any app installed. Both methods are cloud-native and work with legacy 911 infrastructure by creating an over-the-top data channel, enabling quick deployment with minimal changes to existing call centers. Carbyne claims its technology can significantly improve response efficiency (reducing emergency response times by up to 65% on average) by providing first responders with critical situational information before they arrive on scene. The platform also includes capabilities for indoor positioning (to locate callers inside buildings) and integration of additional data sources such as IoT sensors or surveillance feeds to give a comprehensive picture of an incident'), Document(metadata={'title': 'MongoDB Inc.', 'summary': 'MongoDB, Inc. is an American software company that develops and provides commercial support for the source-available database engine MongoDB, a database for unstructured data.

Based in New York City, 10gen was founded by former DoubleClick founder and CTO Dwight Merriman and former DoubleClick CEO and Gilt Groupe founder Kevin P. Ryan with former DoubleClick engineer and ShopWiki founder and CTO Eliot Horowitz and received $81 million in venture capital funding from Flybridge Capital Partners, In-Q-Tel, Intel Capital, New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Red Hat, Sequoia Capital, and Union Square Ventures. 10gen originally aimed to build a platform as a service architecture based entirely on open source components; however, the company was unable to find an existing database platform that met their principles for a cloud architecture. As a result, the company began to develop a document-oriented database system it called MongoDB. After realizing the potential of the software on its own, 10gen's team decided to scrap its cloud platform and focus on maintaining MongoDB instead. In February 2009, 10gen released MongoDB as an open source project. 10gen opened its first west coast office in August 2010, having offices in Palo Alto, Reston, London, Dublin, Barcelona, and Sydney by 2012.\\nIn September 2012, 10gen was in The Wall Street Journal's The Next Big Thing 2012.\\nOn August 27, 2013, 10gen announced that it would change its name to MongoDB Inc., associating itself more closely with what became its flagship products.\\nIn 2013, the Identification Authority of India adopted MongoDB's software to analyze registration trends for new identity documents used to obtain government benefits in India. This raised concerns of potential espionage, since at-the-time MongoDB was partially funded by the United States CIA venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel. As of 2013, there is no evidence in the public domain the CIA actually has any influence over MongoDB.\\nOn August 5, 2014, Dev Ittycheria was appointed president and chief executive officer.\\nBy 2017, MongoDB had raised $311 million in funding from venture capitalists. MongoDB filed for an initial public offering on September 21, 2017 and went public on NASDAQ that October 20. It raised $192 million, valuing the company at $1.6 billion overall. Its market capitalization varied greatly afterwards, reaching $39 billion in 2021 and coming back down to $10 billion by 2024.\\nMongoDB acquired database engine company WiredTiger in 2014, followed by database-as-a-service company MLab for $68 million in 2018. The following year, in 2019, MongoDB acquired a mobile-focused database company called Realm for $39 million.\\nA secondary public offering was held on June 29, 2021. In 2022, MongoDB established its own venture capital fund.\\n\\n\\n== Software ==\\nAs of 2025, MongoDB was the fifth most popular database software. It focuses mostly on managing large databases of unstructured data. It's typically used for mobile and web apps that commonly use unstructured databases. As of 2024, there were 50,000 MongoDB customers. MongoDB was originally best known as a NoSQL database product. The company released a database as-a-service product called Atlas in 2016 that became 70 percent of MongoDB's revenue by 2024.

It enables high-definition video to be transmitted, received, and communicated over a computer network with low latency and high quality. This royalty-free specification supports frame-accurate switching, making it suitable for live video production environments.\\n\\n\\n== Technology ==\\nNDI is designed to run over gigabit Ethernet with the NDI codec. It delivers 1080i high-definition video at variable data rates typically around 100 Mbit/s.\\nBy default, NDI uses multicast DNS to advertise sources on a local area network, such that NDI receivers can automatically discover and offer those sources. It also supports two other discovery modes (NDI Access, NDI Discovery Server) that allow for operations across subnets and without multicast DNS. Sources are created using an arbitrarily selected TCP port from a range of ports on the NDI senders. When a source is requested, a TCP connection is established on the appropriate port with the NDI receiver connecting to the NDI sender. NDI 3.x has options to use UDP multicast or unicast with forward error correction (FEC) instead of TCP, and can load balance streams across multiple network interface controllers (NICs) without using link aggregation. NDI version 4.0 introduces the Multi-TCP transport.\\nNDI carries video, multichannel uncompressed audio, and metadata. Metadata messages can be sent in both directions allowing the sender and receiver to message one another over the connection with arbitrary metadata in XML form. This directional metadata system allows for functionality such as active tally information fed back to sources to understand that they are on-air. NDI also allows senders to determine the number of connected receivers, so they can skip unnecessary processing and network bandwidth utilisation when there are no NDI receiver clients connected. NDI Receivers can opt to connect to various combinations of streams, to support, for instance, audio-only or metadata-only connections where video is not required.\\nThe NDI software development kit (SDK) is available for Windows, Linux, and MacOS, and has also been ported to iOS, tvOS, Android, Raspberry Pi, and FPGA. The Standard NDI SDK is available via a royalty-free proprietary license. The NDI Advanced SDK offers OEMs direct access to and from compressed data and other features, with a commercial license.\\n\\n\\n== Comparison of common IP video protocols ==\\nOther IP video protocols for use in professional video production (rather than IP video used for distribution to end users) include SMPTE 2022, SMPTE 2110, ASPEN (largely superseded by SMPTE 2110) and Sony NMI. There are clear differences in the technology used by these protocols. \\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nNDI was publicly revealed by NewTek on 8 September 2015 and was demonstrated at the International Broadcasting Convention in Amsterdam that week.  The first device shown using NDI was the NewTek TriCaster which delivered an NDI feed from each of its SDI inputs as well as four output feeds from its vision mixer. The TriCaster could also receive up to two NDI sources from other devices.\\nNewTek had previously created a predecessor of NDI called AirSend to get video from external devices into their TriCaster products. AirSend had been implemented by a number of character generator (CG) vendors including Vizrt and Chyron. In order to quickly bring these products into the NDI space, NewTek created a new driver to replace the existing AirSend driver, which could be installed on these existing AirSend-compatible devices, instantly converting them to NDI-compatible devices with no change required by the original CG vendors.\\nBirdDog was an early adopter and in 2018 released Studio NDI, an ASIC implementation of NDI. BirdDog went on to deliver NDI PTZ cameras, along with a host of software applications.\\nAnother early adopter of NDI was VMix, a Windows-based vision mixer that offers NDI inputs and outputs.

It also has the ability to store and process content close to cellular subscribers, for faster response time. Applications can also be exposed to real-time radio access network (RAN) information.\\nThe key element is the MEC application server, which is integrated at the RAN element. This server provides computing resources, storage capacity, connectivity and access to RAN information. It supports a multitenancy run-time and hosting environment for applications.  The virtual appliance applications are delivered as packaged operating system virtual machine (VM) images or containers incorporating operating systems and applications. The platform also provides a set of middleware application and infrastructure services. Application software can be provided from equipment vendors, service providers and third-parties.\\n\\n\\n== Deployment ==\\nThe MEC application server can be deployed at the macro base station EnodeB that is part of an LTE cellular network, or at the Radio Network Controller (RNC) that is part of a 3G cellular network and at a multi-technology cell aggregation site. The multi-technology cell aggregation site can be located indoors or outdoors.\\n\\n\\n== Business and technical benefits ==\\nBy using mobile edge computing technology, a cellular operator can efficiently deploy new services for specific customers or classes of customers. The technology also reduces the signal load of the core network, and can host applications and services in a less costly way. It also collects data about storage, network bandwidth, CPU utilization, etc., for each application or service deployed by a third party. Application developers and content providers can take advantage of close proximity to cellular subscribers and real-time RAN information.\\nMEC has been created using open standards and application programming interfaces (APIs), using common programming models, relevant tool chains and software development kits to encourage and expedite the development of new applications for the new MEC environment.\\n\\n\\n== Applications ==\\nSince MEC architecture has only recently been proposed, there are as yet very few applications that have adopted this architecture. However, many case studies have been proposed in recent articles. Some of the notable applications in mobile edge computing are computational offloading, content delivery, mobile big data analytics, edge video caching, collaborative computing, connected cars, smart venues, smart enterprises, healthcare, smartgrids, service function chaining, indoor positioning, etc.\\n\\n\\n== Current uses ==\\nSome applications which incorporate MEC were made available in 2015.

Trusted execution environments can be instantiated on a computer\\'s processing components such as a central processing unit (CPU) or a graphics processing unit (GPU).  In their various implementations, TEEs can provide different levels of isolation including virtual machine, individual application, or compute functions.\\nTypically, data in use in a computer\\'s compute components and memory exists in a decrypted state and can be vulnerable to examination or tampering by unauthorized software or administrators. According to the CCC, confidential computing protects data in use through a minimum of three properties:\\n\\nData confidentiality: \"Unauthorized entities cannot view data while it is in use within the TEE\".\\nData integrity: \"Unauthorized entities cannot add, remove, or alter data while it is in use within the TEE\".\\nCode integrity: \"Unauthorized entities cannot add, remove, or alter code executing in the TEE\".\\nIn addition to trusted execution environments, remote cryptographic attestation is an essential part of confidential computing.  The attestation process assesses the trustworthiness of a system and helps ensure that confidential data is released to a TEE only after it presents verifiable evidence that it is genuine and operating with an acceptable security posture.  It allows the verifying party to assess the trustworthiness of a confidential computing environment through an \"authentic, accurate, and timely report about the software and data state\" of that environment. \"Hardware-based attestation schemes rely on a trusted hardware component and associated firmware to execute attestation routines in a secure environment\". Without attestation, a compromised system could deceive others into trusting it, claim it is running certain software in a TEE, and potentially compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the data being processed or the integrity of the trusted code.\\n\\n\\n== Technical approaches ==\\nTechnical approaches to confidential computing may vary in which software, infrastructure and administrator elements are allowed to access confidential data. The \"trust boundary,\" which circumscribes a trusted computing base (TCB), defines which elements have the potential to access confidential data, whether they are acting benignly or maliciously.

A straightforward and repeatable deployment process is important for continuous delivery.\\n\\n\\n== Principles ==\\nAccording to Neal Ford, continuous delivery adopts \"Bring the pain forward,\" tackling tough tasks early, fostering automation and swift issue detection. \\nContinuous delivery treats the commonplace notion of a deployment pipeline as a lean Poka-Yoke: a set of validations through which a piece of software must pass on its way to release. Code is compiled if necessary and then packaged by a build server every time a change is committed to a source control repository, then tested by a number of different techniques (possibly including manual testing) before it can be marked as releasable.\\nDevelopers used to a long cycle time may need to change their mindset when working in a CD environment. Any code commit may be released to customers at any point. Patterns such as feature toggles can be very useful for committing code early which is not yet ready for use by end users. Using NoSQL can eliminate the step of data migrations and schema changes, often manual steps or exceptions to a continuous delivery workflow. Other useful techniques for developing code in isolation such as code branching are not obsolete in a CD world, but must be adapted to fit the principles of CD - for example, running multiple long-lived code branches can prove impractical, as a releasable artifact must be built early in the CD process from a single code branch if it is to pass through all phases of the pipeline.\\n\\n\\n== Deployment pipeline ==\\n\\nContinuous delivery is enabled through the deployment pipeline. The purpose of the deployment pipeline has three components: visibility, feedback, and continually deploy.\\n\\nVisibility – All aspects of the delivery system including building, deploying, testing, and releasing are visible to every member of the team to promote collaboration.\\nFeedback – Team members learn of problems as soon as possible when they occur so that they are able to fix them as quickly as possible.\\nContinually deploy – Through a fully automated process, you can deploy and release any version of the software to any environment.\\n\\nAccording to Yan Cui, when it comes to serverless environments, ephemeral resources should be kept together and have their own deployment pipeline to achieve a high cohesion. However, shared resources that have a long spin-up time and landing zone should have their own separate repository, deployment pipeline and stack. \\n\\n\\n== Tools/tool types ==\\nContinuous delivery takes automation from source control all the way through production. There are various tools that help accomplish all or part of this process. These tools are part of the deployment pipeline which includes continuous delivery. The types of tools that execute various parts of the process include: continuous integration, application release automation, build automation, application lifecycle management.\\n\\n\\n== Architecting for continuous delivery ==\\nTo practice continuous delivery effectively, software applications have to meet a set of architecturally significant requirements (ASRs) such as deployability, modifiability, and testability. These ASRs require a high priority and cannot be traded off lightly.\\nMicroservices are often used when architecting for continuous delivery.

Throughout 2024, roughly half of then-employed AI safety researchers left OpenAI, citing the company\\'s prominent role in an industry-wide problem.\\n\\n\\n== Founding ==\\n\\nIn December 2015, OpenAI was founded as a not for profit organization by Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba, with Sam Altman and Elon Musk as the co-chairs. A total of $1 billion in capital was pledged by Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Infosys. The actual collected total amount of contributions was only $130 million until 2019.\\nThe organization stated it would \"freely collaborate\" with other institutions and researchers by making some of its patents and research open to the public. OpenAI was initially run from Brockman\\'s living room. It was later headquartered at the Pioneer Building in the Mission District, San Francisco.\\nAccording to OpenAI\\'s charter, its founding mission is \"to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work—benefits all of humanity.\"\\nMusk and Altman stated in 2015 that they were partly motivated by concerns about AI safety and existential risk from artificial general intelligence. OpenAI stated that \"it\\'s hard to fathom how much human-level AI could benefit society\", and that it is equally difficult to comprehend \"how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly\". The startup also wrote that AI \"should be an extension of individual human wills and, in the spirit of liberty, as broadly and evenly distributed as possible\", and that \"because of AI\\'s surprising history, it\\'s hard to predict when human-level AI might come within reach. When it does, it\\'ll be important to have a leading research institution which can prioritize a good outcome for all over its own self-interest.\" Co-chair Sam Altman expected a decades-long project that eventually surpasses human intelligence.\\nBrockman met with Yoshua Bengio, one of the \"founding fathers\" of deep learning, and drew up a list of great AI researchers. Brockman was able to hire nine of them as the first employees in December 2015.

Grady Booch first proposed the term CI in 1991, although he did not advocate integrating multiple times a day, but later, CI came to include that aspect.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe earliest known work (1989) on continuous integration was the Infuse environment developed by G. E. Kaiser, D. E. Perry, and W. M. Schell.\\nIn 1994, Grady Booch used the phrase continuous integration in Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications (2nd edition) to explain how, when developing using micro processes, \"internal releases represent a sort of continuous integration of the system, and exist to force closure of the micro process\".\\nIn 1997, Kent Beck and Ron Jeffries invented extreme programming (XP) while on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System project, including continuous integration. Beck published about continuous integration in 1998, emphasising the importance of face-to-face communication over technological support. In 1999, Beck elaborated more in his first full book on Extreme Programming. CruiseControl, one of the first open-source CI tools, was released in 2001.\\nIn 2010, Timothy Fitz published an article detailing how IMVU\\'s engineering team had built and been using the first practical CD system. While his post was originally met with skepticism, it quickly caught on and found widespread adoption as part of the lean software development methodology, also based on IMVU.\\n\\n\\n== Practices ==\\nThe core activities of CI are developers co-locate code changes in a shared, integration area frequently and that the resulting integrated codebase is verified for correctness. The first part generally involves merging changes to a common version control branch. The second part generally involves automated processes including: building, testing and many other processes.\\nTypically, a server builds from the integration area frequently; i.e. after each commit or periodically like once a day. The server may perform quality control checks such as running unit tests and collect software quality metrics via processes such as static analysis and performance testing.\\n\\n\\n=== Build automation ===\\n\\nBuild automation is a best practice. Build automation tools automate building. \\nProponents of CI recommend that a single command should have the capability of building the system. \\nAutomation often includes automating the integration, which often includes deployment into a production-like environment. In many cases, the build script not only compiles binaries but also generates documentation, website pages, statistics and distribution media (such as Debian DEB, Red Hat RPM or Windows MSI files).\\n\\n\\n=== Atomic commits ===\\nCI requires the version control system to support atomic commits; i.e., all of a developer\\'s changes are handled as a single commit.\\n\\n\\n=== Committing changes ===\\nWhen making a code change, a developer creates a branch that is a copy of the current codebase. As other changes are committed to the repository, this copy diverges from the latest version.\\nThe longer development continues on a branch without merging to the integration branch, the greater the risk of multiple integration conflicts and failures when the developer branch is eventually merged back. When developers submit code to the repository they must first update their code to reflect the changes in the repository since they took their copy. The more changes the repository contains, the more work developers must do before submitting their own changes.\\nEventually, the repository may become so different from the developers\\' baselines that they enter what is sometimes referred to as \"merge hell\", or \"integration hell\", '), Document(metadata={'title': 'Meteorology', 'summary': \"Meteorology is the scientific study of the Earth's atmosphere and short-term atmospheric phenomena (i.e., weather), with a focus on weather forecasting.

Ancient religions believed meteorological phenomena to be under the control of the gods. The ability to predict rains and floods based on annual cycles was evidently used by humans at least from the time of agricultural settlement if not earlier. Early approaches to predicting weather were based on astrology and were practiced by priests. The Egyptians had rain-making rituals as early as 3500 BC. \\nAncient Indian Upanishads contain mentions of clouds and seasons.

In 2005 and 2006, both Intel (VT-x) and AMD (AMD-V) introduced limited hardware virtualization support that allowed simpler virtualization software but offered very few speed benefits. Greater hardware support, which allowed substantial speed improvements, came with later processor models.\\n\\n\\n== Software-based virtualization ==\\nThe following discussion focuses only on virtualization of the x86 architecture protected mode.\\nIn protected mode the operating system kernel runs in kernel space at the most privileged level (ring 0) that allows it to configure the MMU, manage physical memory, and directly control I/O peripherals, while applications run in user space at a lower privilege level (such as ring 3), where they are confined to their own virtual address spaces and must invoke system calls to request I/O operations or other privileged services from the kernel.\\nIn software-based virtualization, a host OS has direct access to hardware while the guest operating systems, have limited access to hardware, similarly to other user space application of the host OS. One approach used in x86 software-based virtualization to implement this mechanism is called ring deprivileging, which involves running the guest OS at a ring higher (lesser privileged) than 0, so that attempts to execute privileged instructions can be intercepted and handled by the hypervisor.\\nThree techniques made virtualization of protected mode possible:\\n\\nBinary translation is used to rewrite certain ring 0 instructions in terms of ring 3 instructions, such as POPF, that would otherwise fail silently or behave differently when executed above ring 0, making the classic trap-and-emulate virtualization impossible. To improve performance, the translated basic blocks need to be cached in a coherent way that detects code patching (used in VxDs for instance), the reuse of pages by the guest OS, or even self-modifying code.\\nA number of key data structures used by a processor need to be shadowed. Because most operating systems use paged virtual memory, and granting the guest OS direct access to the MMU would mean loss of control by the virtualization manager, some of the work of the x86 MMU needs to be duplicated in software for the guest OS using a technique known as shadow page tables. This involves denying the guest OS any access to the actual page table entries by trapping access attempts and emulating them instead in software. The x86 architecture uses hidden state to store segment descriptors in the processor, so once the segment descriptors have been loaded into the processor, the memory from which they have been loaded may be overwritten and there is no way to get the descriptors back from the processor. Shadow descriptor tables must therefore be used to track changes made to the descriptor tables by the guest OS.\\nI/O device emulation: Unsupported devices on the guest OS must be emulated by a device emulator that runs in the host OS.\\nThese techniques incur some performance overhead due to lack of MMU virtualization support, as compared to a VM running on a natively virtualizable architecture such as the IBM System/370.\\nOn traditional mainframes, the classic type 1 hypervisor was self-standing and did not depend on any operating system or run any user applications itself. In contrast, the first x86 virtualization products were aimed at workstation computers, and ran a guest OS inside a host OS by embedding the hypervisor in a kernel module that ran under the host OS (type 2 hypervisor).\\nThere has been some controversy whether the x86 architecture with no hardware assistance is virtualizable as described by Popek and Goldberg.

It is a strong metal with low density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in color. Due to its relatively high melting point (1,668 °C or 3,034 °F) it has sometimes been described as a refractory metal, but this is not the case. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity compared to other metals. Titanium is superconducting when cooled below its critical temperature of 0.49 K.\\n\\nCommercially pure (99.2% pure) grades of titanium have ultimate tensile strength of about 434 MPa (63,000 psi), equal to that of common, low-grade steel alloys, but are less dense. Titanium is 60% denser than aluminium, but more than twice as strong as the most commonly used 6061-T6 aluminium alloy. Certain titanium alloys (e.g., Beta C) achieve tensile strengths of over 1,400 MPa (200,000 psi). However, titanium loses strength when heated above 430 °C (806 °F).\\nTitanium is not as hard as some grades of heat-treated steel; it is non-magnetic and a poor conductor of heat and electricity. Machining requires precautions, because the material can gall unless sharp tools and proper cooling methods are used. Like steel structures, those made from titanium have a fatigue limit that guarantees longevity in some applications.\\nThe metal is a dimorphic allotrope of a hexagonal close packed α form that changes into a body-centered cubic (lattice) β form at 882 °C (1,620 °F). The specific heat of the α form increases dramatically as it is heated to this transition temperature but then falls and remains fairly constant for the β form regardless of temperature.\\n\\n\\n=== Chemical properties ===\\n\\nLike aluminium and magnesium, the surface of titanium metal and its alloys oxidizes immediately upon exposure to air\")]\n"

According to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, React is one of the most commonly used web technologies.\n",
      "React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js and React Router. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. A key advantage of React is that it only re-renders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary re-rendering of unchanged DOM elements. React is used by an estimated 6% of all websites.\n",

      "Page: Deep learning\n",
      "Summary: In machine learning, deep learning focuses on utilizing multilayered neural networks to perform tasks such as classification, regression, and representation learning. The field takes inspiration from biological neuroscience and is centered around stacking artificial neurons into layers and \"training\" them to process data. The adjective \"deep\" refers to the use of multiple layers (ranging from three to several hundred or thousands) in the network. Methods used can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.\n",
      "Some common deep learning network architectures include fully connected networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks, transformers, and neural radiance fields. These architectures have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.\n",
      "Early forms of neural networks were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems, particularly the human brain. However, current neural networks do not intend to model the brain function of organisms, and are generally seen as low-quality models for that purpose.\n",

It can be used in Python as well as JavaScript environments, which means that it can be used by a large number of developers. In contrast to more basic chain-based systems, LangGraph is a graph-based system that coordinates AI workflows. This means that instead of a linear sequence of steps, an application is modeled as a directed graph of nodes and edges. [...] Imagine creating an AI application in which several language model agents collaborate on a complex task. It may be difficult to coordinate these agents, keep context across steps and achieve reliable results. LangGraph is a tool for solving this challenge. It is a framework on LangChain ecosystem that gives a way to define, coordinate, and execute multiple LLM (Large Language Model) agents in complex workflows. In other words, for anyone wondering what is LangGraph, it is a stateful [...] workflow continues. To put it briefly, LangGraph is about coordinating various AI elements to operate in coordination, have memory of previous interactions, and enable complex control flows within an application.',\n",

It's exciting, but it comes with challenges: managing the state of various agents, coordinating their interactions, and handling errors effectively. This is where LangGraph can help.\\n\\nLangGraph is a library within the LangChain ecosystem designed to tackle these challenges head-on. LangGraph provides a framework for defining, coordinating, and executing multiple LLM agents (or chains) in a structured manner. [...] For applications requiring autonomous decision-making, LangGraph enables the creation of agents that can perform tasks independently based on user inputs and predefined logic.\\n\\nThese agents can execute complex workflows, interact with other systems, and adapt to new information dynamically. LangGraph's structured framework ensures that each agent operates efficiently and effectively, making it suitable for tasks like automated customer support, data processing, and system monitoring. [...] In educational platforms, LangGraph can be used to create adaptive learning environments that cater to individual learning styles and needs. Multiple agents can assess a student's progress, provide customized exercises, and offer real-time feedback. The stateful nature of LangGraph ensures that the system retains information about each learner's performance and preferences, enabling a more personalized and effective educational experience.\\n\\nConclusion\",\n",

Early movers are using AI agents to handle tasks that were once bottlenecks, gaining an edge in customer responsiveness, data analysis, and innovation capacity.

      "### Practical Gains: Save Time and Money While Reducing Errors [...] Another advantage of the LangGraph approach is that one can precisely control when and how agents interact. The graph’s edges and nodes act like a playbook for the team of agents. One can have phases in the workflow where agents work in parallel, and then points where the workflow pauses and awaits a decision or input. [...] This approach has strong parallels to how human teams work, and indeed some benefits are the same: specialization, parallel effort, and oversight. Using LangGraph, developers have successfully built multi-agent workflows such as an AI “newsroom” where different agents (reporter, fact-checker, editor) produce a news article together, and complex support systems where an AI triages issues and delegates to expert sub-agents.

      "Sometimes, even the smartest AI agents need a little human guidance. LangGraph allows you to easily integrate human input into the process. You can pause your AI agent, have a person check its plan, tweak things if needed, and then continue the workflow. This makes LangGraph perfect for creating reliable AI systems that need to be trusted in business settings—where AI can do most of the work, but a human keeps an eye on the really critical decisions. [...] Compared to other AI frameworks, LangGraph gives you more power and flexibility. If you’ve used LangChain before, you know it’s amazing for building chains of LLM-powered tasks, like calling an API or generating responses. LangGraph goes beyond those linear chains—it lets you create decision-making loops, pauses for human checks, and elaborate multi-agent setups.\n",

      "LangGraph is a framework within LangChain designed for creating dynamic, stateful workflows that go beyond linear processes. It allows AI systems to revisit decisions, manage complex tasks, and collaborate across multiple agents. This makes it ideal for scenarios like customer support, research, and content moderation, where workflows need flexibility and decision-making based on context. [...] LangGraph introduces a graph-based workflow system that reimagines how processes are structured. Unlike traditional linear workflows that follow a straightforward step-by-step path, LangGraph organizes tasks as a network of interconnected nodes and edges. This design allows for dynamic decision-making, branching paths, and feedback loops, making it particularly well-suited for managing intricate, multi-step AI processes. [...] LangGraph stands out as a framework designed to handle complex, non-linear workflows where traditional linear processes often fall short. Its strengths lie in scenarios requiring multi-path decision-making, collaboration among multiple agents, and iterative refinement.\n",

       "## Strategic Integration of LangGraph: Unlocking Business Potential\n",
       "\n",
       "### Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI technologies, LangGraph has emerged as a pivotal framework for enterprises aiming to enhance their strategic positioning and achieve significant returns on investment (ROI). As companies increasingly adopt AI agent frameworks like LangGraph, they are witnessing transformative impacts on productivity, cost efficiency, and market competitiveness. This report delves into the business implications of integrating LangGraph, highlighting its potential to drive innovation and maintain a competitive edge.\n",
       "\n",
       "LangGraph stands out for its structured reasoning capabilities, which allow enterprises to develop sophisticated, production-grade AI systems capable of handling complex real-world requirements. This framework not only supports efficient resource utilization but also offers scalable solutions that can lead to better ROI for large-scale deployments [1]. The strategic choice between LangGraph and other frameworks like LangChain is crucial, as it influences an organization's AI development trajectory and long-term success [2].\n",
       "\n",
       "One of the most compelling aspects of LangGraph is its ability to enhance developer productivity and streamline operations. By automating complex processes such as invoice reconciliation and security alert triage, companies like Cognosys and Adept have reported over 60% reductions in manual labor [3]. This efficiency translates into substantial cost savings and improved customer loyalty, contributing to a projected 150% ROI over two years for some enterprises [1].\n",
       "\n",
       "Moreover, LangGraph's architecture facilitates complete state tracking and checkpointing, providing natural audit trails that simplify compliance reporting. This feature is particularly beneficial for compliance-sensitive industries, where maintaining audit logs can be challenging [2]. The framework's ability to integrate seamlessly with existing setups and reduce redundant work further enhances its appeal to engineering leaders seeking to unlock collective intelligence from the best models without vendor lock-in [4].\n",
       "\n",
       "The strategic integration of LangGraph also involves a phased approach to measuring ROI. Enterprises are advised to start with low-risk pilots tied to clear business outcomes, build trust and momentum by socializing wins, and scale intentionally by integrating pilots into processes and platforms [5]. This methodical approach ensures that AI adoption not only unlocks ROI but also aligns with long-term business objectives.\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, LangGraph offers a robust framework for enterprises looking to innovate and stay ahead of the competition. Its structured approach to AI development, combined with its scalability and compliance benefits, makes it a strategic asset for companies aiming to maximize their ROI and achieve sustainable growth.\n",

       "\n",
       "The integration of generative AI into cricket is revolutionizing the sport, offering unprecedented opportunities to enhance player performance, strategy development, and fan engagement. This report explores the multifaceted applications of AI in cricket, from simulating historical matches and predicting future outcomes to optimizing team management and training. AI-driven tools are reshaping strategic decision-making and providing real-time insights, enriching the fan experience. As AI continues to evolve, its impact on cricket is expected to grow, offering exciting possibilities for players, coaches, and fans alike, while expanding the sport's global reach.\n",

       "The integration of generative AI into various fields, including drug discovery, clinical trials, and cricket, is transforming traditional practices by enhancing efficiency, precision, and engagement. In drug discovery, generative AI significantly reduces the time and cost associated with developing new drugs. By leveraging advanced algorithms, AI identifies novel compounds and predicts their interactions with biological targets, as demonstrated by Insilico Medicine's accelerated development of a drug for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [1]. Generative models like VAEs and GANs are pivotal in proposing novel molecules and optimizing their properties, as evidenced by NVIDIA's collaboration with Recursion Pharmaceuticals, which screened over 2.8 quadrillion small molecule-target pairs in a week [1][2]. However, the accuracy of AI predictions depends on the quality of training datasets, necessitating rigorous validation and ethical considerations to ensure responsible use [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "In clinical trials, generative AI optimizes trial design, enhances patient recruitment, and improves data analysis, potentially accelerating the delivery of life-saving treatments. AI can automate documentation and streamline regulatory submissions, reducing costs and speeding up the trial process [3]. However, challenges such as data quality, regulatory compliance, and ethical considerations must be addressed through collaborative and transparent approaches [1][2][4]. Interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial to navigate these challenges and promote the adoption of AI in clinical research [5][6].\n",
       "\n",
       "The ethical implications of generative AI in drug discovery and clinical trials are significant. The potential for AI to produce misleading information and exacerbate algorithmic bias raises concerns about patient safety and equity [1][3]. Addressing these issues requires strict standards for data security, transparency, and oversight mechanisms to align AI adoption with ethical standards and societal values [1][2].\n",
       "\n",
       "In cricket, AI is revolutionizing the sport by enhancing player performance, strategy development, and fan engagement. AI-driven simulations allow players to practice against virtual opponents, refining their techniques and preparing for various match scenarios [1][3]. Tools like Hawk-Eye and SportVU provide comprehensive performance data, enabling coaches to tailor training programs and optimize player performance [2]. Predictive analytics tools, such as CricViz, aid in strategic decision-making by analyzing past performance data to predict match outcomes [4]. AI also enhances fan engagement by providing real-time insights and interactive experiences, enriching the viewing experience and fostering a stronger connection between fans and the sport [5].\n",
       "\n",
       "Generative AI's role in cricket extends to simulating historical matches and predicting future performances, offering strategic advantages and enriching the fan experience [1][2]. AI-driven models using deep learning techniques have shown superior accuracy in predicting match outcomes, incorporating environmental data to enhance predictive capabilities [2]. AI tools also simulate fantasy leagues and generate what-if scenarios, aiding strategic planning and engaging fans [1][3]. The predictive power of AI in forecasting player performance and suitability for specific match conditions is particularly valuable for team management [4].\n",
       "\n",
       "Globally, AI is increasing cricket's popularity by making the sport more accessible and engaging. AI-driven virtual reality experiences and personalized content delivery are transforming the traditional viewing experience, expanding cricket's global reach [8][9]. As AI continues to evolve, its impact on cricket is expected to grow, offering exciting possibilities for players, coaches, and fans alike.\n",
